# Fictional-Chocolate-Company-Sales-Analytics-using-Power-BI
This project analyzes the sales performance of a fictional chocolate company using Power BI. I generated a fictional dataset using an AI tool and built an interactive dashboard to uncover insights across products, countries, and time periods.  The goal was to practice data analytics, visualization, and storytelling with data.

Key Insights ive extracted:

Top-selling Products: Identified which chocolate variants drive the highest shipments.

Revenue Trends: Month-by-month and quarter-based sales patterns with spikes & dips.

Country Performance: Compared shipments across markets (India ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³, USA ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸, Australia, UK, etc.).

Growth vs Decline: Used waterfall charts to analyze products contributing to revenue growth or decline.

Salespeople & Teams: (optional if you add that view) Breakdown of contributions at the salesperson/team level.


Skills ive Practiced:

* Data Cleaning & Loading

* Data Modeling in Power BI

* Creating Interactive Dashboards

* Storytelling with Data

* Business Intelligence


The Future Enhancements I can do:

Adding forecasting for sales trends

More drill-down reports (by salesperson/team)

Integration with real datasets
