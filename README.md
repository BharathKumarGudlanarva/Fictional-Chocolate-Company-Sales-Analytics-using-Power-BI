# Fictional-Chocolate-Company-Sales-Analytics-using-Power-BI
This project analyzes the sales performance of a fictional chocolate company using Power BI. I generated a fictional dataset using an AI tool and built an interactive dashboard to uncover insights across products, countries, and time periods.  The goal was to practice data analytics, visualization, and storytelling with data.
